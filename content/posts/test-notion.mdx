[MB Technical Essay.pdf](Mars%20Based/MB_Technical_Essay.pdf)

Let’s use this essay/interviews to review my skills and also learn new things if
possible, but without going too crazy on a particular topic for now 🙏

## TODO tommorrow:

### 1 - Build codebase

✅ See if we can use the https://github.com/hamed-channel/portfolio

and https://github.com/hamed-channel/next-mdx-portfolio, basically use nextv15
in the complete portfolio, see if it works

Then we can go ahead and follow the youtube
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSi_x29bBmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSi_x29bBmE)

### 2 - Start answering questions

Dont try to be perfect, just jot down your thoughts, and later I can try to
polish it if needed

  it yours (and see how it was done, if you are curious). Its on top of radix
  and tailwind, and it’s like copy paste. When you init it in your project, it
  can also add theming whihc can be interesting to have
- Tailwind:
  - https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss (sorts the
    tailwind classes)
- envirnoment variables (pel local .env, i despres en cloud els secrets)
- datadog or logging

* ❓ what is my reasoning? I would normally try to see what the client is
  already doing or what our company is already doing ( so we already have some
  experiencience and potential help). Otherwise, check the docs, what is the
  state of the art in the developer community, what is hot but stable enough and
  hopefully mainstream (so it doesnt get deprecated, and also more devs know
  about it - I am indie in music, but not so much in development)

  Very cool to have things like prettier-tailwind, in the sense that if we can
  standarise the codebase, its better for ourselves and if we work with other
  developers ( probably nowadays or in the near future, we can do a lot of it
  with AI, like having an agent? correcting PRs according to some code
  guidelines)

Sometimes I’m happy enough if I know things “exist”, like I know the pointers if
I need to use it. Then, when the time comes, I deep dive into it. Otherwise, I
feel like I’m going into a rabbithole that -even if its very interesting- might
not be applicable at the moment, and probably I will forget about it in a few
weeks if I dont use it regularly. So I try to help myself by checking on things
high-level-wise, and then do deep dives when needed.

### ❓How you prefer to structure applications in Next.js and why. The more detail, the better.

👉 It’s an interesting question, and probably an opportunity to convey how I try
to work within teams, when starting a project (or continuing it) In general,
when deciding how to structure applications, I would first reach out to other
teammates or client to find out if there are already some guidelines or
requirements .We might be able to leverage some past experiences, or sometimes
there might be just some ideas that we want to try out. As I see it, there are
so many good ways to structure a project (as long as it makes sense, its
consistent with the framework docs and ideally some trusted sources have tried
it out in production), and it might also depend on the specific needs of a
project. At the end of the day, for me the most important part is that there is
a clear separation of concerns, and that the structure is respected by everybody
working on the project, so there is a predictability and we can reduce friction.
I like the new hottest thing as much as any other developer, but we need to be
practical and consider if it is stable enough and hopefully mainstream (so it
doesnt get deprecated, there’s enough documentation, and also more devs know
about it)

I heard a youtuber say once that “everything looks cool when you start a
project, but when you get to 10k lines you start to see if your initial
decisions drag you down or not”. And I think it makes sense! As project grows,
we get to learn from some unexpected problems on how to scale. This is why I
tend to favor well-tested practices, but since every project is different, we
might need to adapt to the circumstances as the project grows.

That said, if I had to propose a structure, actually this portfolio next.js app
could be a good example of a setup I would be happy to follow!
https://github.com/lluissuros/mars-based-portfolio (in case you anybody wants to
dig into the details)

Let me unpack my thoughts below:

- I am pretty used to Typescript, and honestly for me is one of the best things
  that happened to the language. It makes the code much more readable, secure,
  the interfaces are clear and it’s super important when working with many
  developers.
- I find the app **router** very clear for route organisation. Nowadays with
  server components, most of the content is statically generated, and also make
  sure that in dynamic routes we use `**generateStaticParams**` to specify the
  availably pages, to be also rendered statically.
  - Also, by following the guidelines on Next.js documentation we can acces to
    built-in optimisations like code splitting, or image optimisation, or
    caching (when needed, I would not enable caching by default because it can
    lead to confusing bugs)
  - (but) Many projects might not need SSR that much (specially Saas where
    rendering performance/SEO is maybe not that important). I wouldn’t force a
    big refactor from the old Pages Router just for the sake of it (at Notabene,
    we were using Pages Router and we never updated Next, because it was _good
    enough_ and it didn’t really give that much benefit to end users. \*\*
  - I still don’t have experience with them on a big codebase, but I find the
    new “Server Components by default” approach very cool, makes sense to me
    that the client should only be fetching data when interactivity is needed,
    otherwise we can resort to SSR. There are some caveats though, for example
    I’m not so sure how to unit test them 🤔
  - I would leave the `page.tsx` as simple as possible, and just import
    components from `/components` folder
- /**components folder:** If the folder grows a lot, I would advocate for some
  type or re-ordering (eg by domain, or by more “core/reusable” vs “layout”),
  but I would not overengineer from the start. I’m not a big fan of very big
  components, and I tend to favor breaking it down into manageable pieces.
- **/test** folder: I normally like to centralise tests and test custom logic
  like mocks and config.
- **/utils , /lib** : A centralized place to have custom logic
  - I might also want to have dedicated folders for React Hooks, or Server
    Actions
  - Having some important separate funcitions might help thorough unit testing
    with Jest or RTL

Many next.js projects are 90% front end (+ some logic for connecting to
backends), but others can be heavy on the business logic ( I have a friend in a
startup -they’re good programmers- that they have a huge Next.js monolith with
all the business logic, they dont use any separate “backend” at all, and they
also handle the acces layer to DB in the same next.js repo). It was good for
them to grow the project faster, and only now after 2 years, they see the need
for a decoupling (they now prefer to scale front and back independently). This
kind of experiences remind me that what’s important is to think about our use
case, about what brings value to the user and what will make sense in the
mid-term in terms of growing the app while maintaining flexibility.

### ❓Which libraries you typically use with Next.js.

Nowadays, I would say that my main go-to libraries would be:

- **Typescript:** (not sure if we can consider it a library) It provides so much
  clarity on the code, the developer experience also boosts a lot once you get
  used to it (I’ve been using it for about 5 years). Now with AI, it’s even
  easier to use and it can help provide clear interfaces between components and
  external APIs
- **Tailwind:** Or another similar of CSS library (eg Chakra UI). Actually most
  of my work has been around Styled Components, but I’ve been finding Tailwind a
  pleasure to use, it’s really close to the CSS syntax, and it seems to merge
  with nicely with component libraries like Radix UI and Shadcn. Since it’s very
  mainstream, it also helps when using AI agents.
  - One thing I would use is an abstracted CSS theming or style palette (see
    `globals.css` for an example). This will also provide a quick view on the
    style guide we are following.
  - We can also use nice helper libraries like `next-themes` to manage dark mode
    (or any other theme change)
  - I also find prettier+tailwind library super useful and it helps avoid
    conflicts and discussions between developers (for example, by sorting the
    tailwind classes).
- **Component library:** In the past, I have been guilty of creating component
  libraries from scratch, usually bringing up a good amount of pain over time,
  since the requirements keep changing and the reusable components tend to
  increase in complexity (for example during my time a Travelperk, pretty much
  every UI component was in-house coded, to the point that many components had
  dozens of props). Nowadays, I would advocate for using out-of-the-box
  component libraries, learning their catalog well and only expand or write UI
  components from scratch if its really needed. Lately I find
  [radixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) very good for the job, since the
  components are pretty much unstyled while logically complete (with
  accessibility and all the difficult quirks) and it combines very well with
  Tailwind. I am also now playing with
  [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) and I find the approach
  really cool, since you just download the code (like a copy paste) and can edit
  it locally to your needs.
- **Unit testing** with jest, React Testing Library, even cypress for more
  integration testing if the app is mature enough.
- **zod:** Basically for validation. For example, it can be used in client-side
  forms to make sure the user input is consistent with the expected schema, and
  also when dealing with external APIs, to have a run-time safety check that the
  received data corresponds with what we are expecting. Since the types are
  declared as schemas, both backend and fronted can share the same contract.
- **Some fetching libraries?** I’m not a fan of overusing libraries, but I’ve
  found useSWR very useful in the past to deal with data revalidation and
  caching, also axios is nice. If

I guess the list could continue, but these would be my main picks, and the rest
would depend on the project!

### ❓What you consider most important when using Tailwind to style a React application.

I’m have limited experience with Tailwind within a big codebase (I used it for
my projects, but never professionally yet). But I think the main arquitecture
points are still valid, regardless the library; in general, what we really want
to avoid is to have hardcoded values all around the code (which makes design
changes a real pain)

I would put effort into standarising the design styleguide basics beforehand (ie
colors, sizes, radius, fonts) on the theme. I think that as long as these values
are centralised, there is room for experimentation with different libraries or
approaches.

In the same manner, we can also abstract CSS classes away, specially as we see
some patterns emerge through the codebase. I think it’s useful but only when
it’s needed; I like how just looking at the tailwind attributes can give a
pretty good idea of how the components is styled (but it can be overwhelming
when there is lots of attributes).

I find it very helpful to use libraries like prettier-tailwind, in the sense
that if we can standarise the codebase, its better for our own readability and
specially if we work with other developers.

### ❓How you believe an application should be built to remain maintainable over time.

I think as I gained experience, many of the principles have become more like a
“gut feeling” instead of a requirements list over time, but this is what comes
to mind now:

In general, I would try to have separation of concerns (ie routing, components,
utils, api-related logic, business logic if any, DB access, auth, infra, etc).
If any of these “folders“ grow too much, consider diving it into logical units
(ie domains, or maybe follow some
[Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) principles)

I would try to use mainstream libraries that I know will probably stick around
(next, react, tailwind, etc), and use their conventions as much as possible
before jumping into creating complicated custom middleware or workarounds (I’ve
been guilty of just not reading the docs enough in the past, and miss simpler
native solutions).

As much as possible, having a good unit test coverage can help a lot into
maintaining a robust application. Typescript can help a lot in welcoming new
developers to the codebase, since it’s much easier to find out what are the
expected data types around the app. In the same sense, the obvious but necessary
linters and code formatters (which should be applied both in editor as in the PR
pipeline)

In terms of components, avoid huge components (it’s actually really just
separating concerns again)

### ❓Common issues that arise with Next.js and how you typically solve them.

Honestly my main issue is that Next.js changes often (I guess they are keeping
up and sometimes leading the web development and React ecosystems). There has
been important breaking changes in the last years, I for a mature product on an
older version, it might not be worth refactoring and updating, but then it
becomes harder to finde proper solutions to new features. Luckily I find the
docs really good, and AI agents seem to adjust to the working Next.js version
pretty well. I’ve also found that these AI agents can help out immensely into
navigating complex library upgrades (ideally together with a good unit test
coverage)

Maybe also the new RSC approach might bring issues when to use Client
components, in order to optimise the performance. In general, I’m trying to
stick to the rule of “everything is a server component unless it needs
interactivity or browser APIs”. I’m still trying to find good ways of debugging
RSC, since they don’t appear in the browser and they need to be approach more
like in a backend style (logging)

In the past I’ve also find some caching behaviours. In general nowadays I would
think about carefully, trying to find out which parts of the app can be
statically rendered, which ones might work with periodic revalidation, and which
ones need zero caching because they need to be updated as much as possible (like
dashboards, or more real time components)

### ❓How you would approach authentication and authorization in a Next.js application.

I have to say I’ve use auth in the projects I’ve worked on, but I never set it
myself. Sometimes I’m happy enough if I know things “exist”, like I know the
pointers if I need to use it. Then, when the time comes, I deep dive into it!
But in any case, I would first survey on our team/company to see if somebody had
hands-on experience on any library or platform for auth. I value a lot the
hands-on experience, and also if we can standarise practices across projects
(this way, it’s also easier to ask for help or share experiences). If it were up
to me to decide, I would first do some research and get a couple or 3
candidates. For example, nowadays I could ponder between
[auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) (which seems easier to implement, and apparently
comes from the same team as Next.js, and seems very integrated to the next.js
flow), [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) (seems to have very good
reviews, lots of tutorials available, also self-hosted and open-source), and
auth0 (we were using it at Notabene, it worked as an external SaaS, it had a
nice dashboard, we could also manage M2M tokens from there for our API
business). Depending on the need of the project, I would then go ahead and build
a prototype. For the 3 solutions above, I would consider if we need to issue M2M
credentials (then use auth0, which is also easier to handle for non-coders on
our company), otherwise I’d go first with the self-hosted solutions.

Regarding roles and permissions, in my experience there is a table on our DB
where we store the role for each User. We should also set the permissions for
each role (ie the actions and information she is allowed to access) in a
convenient way, for example a JSON or TS enums. I believe typically this role
can be encoded in the JWT, but I’m happy to be proven wrong.

In any case, later on in our codebase (frontend and backend) we need to add
checks based on the user role and permissions, so for example we can throw an
error if the user is trying to access an API without the permissions for it.

Also, really make sure there is no leakage on the front end about the tokens
(keep them in the next.js server side), and never commit any API key or secret
into the codebase, just use the secrets manager on the cloud providers
