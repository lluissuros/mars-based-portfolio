### ❓ What you value about TypeScript.

In my opinion I think its one of the best things that happened to javascript! I
love sketching things out in plain js, for example I always enjoyed the
accessibilty of jotting things down on the Developer Tools in the browser
console, or just in any node terminal.

But being able to add typing to JS is what empowers the language to be able to
build big applications that scale with security, avoiding bugs and also serving
as a kind of documentation for other developers building or interfacing with the
codebase.

Another valuable impact is that it can serve as a contract between different
layers across the stack like frontend and backend (we can also validate with zod
or openAPI), and also through the Database via typed ORMs

One thing I also like is that it can be applied gradually in a codebase, so even
if a project or feature started quick and dirty with plain js, we can gradually
update its files to use Typescript.

### ❓Automated tests in the frontend and backend. Are they needed? What do you prioritize? Describe your overall experience writing tests for the apps you’ve built.

I’m a big fan of unit testing, specially in big projects, but I think there are
many considerations and priorities. My top priority would be to cover business
logic properly, specially in the backend (it can also help us structure the code
into small, testable functions). I would normally try to enforce a very thorough
coverage on the backend side, specially with unit tests. In my experience,
writing tests get easier once there is patterns in place to follow - sometimes,
it might be challenging to find the right way to mock, inject dependencies etc.
Once it is done for one test, I find it easy to just repeat the patterns around.

In general terms, I would advocate for strong unit testing on the backend, and
integration testing covering the main expected behaviours of the endpoints (we
did it with Postman at Notabene)

**About Front End testing:**

I also used jest in the Front End with React Testing Library, and I had mixed
feelings: I think it offers a lot of value when testing complex behaviours in a
component or library, but I also felt that sometimes the effort to make tests
work was very sustancial compared to the return.

So around the front-end, I try to be critical on which areas of the code I want
to unit test (maybe now this is changing with AI tools, which can help in
dealing with the tests scaffolding and reduce friction on the creation of
tests). In general terms, I find more valuable the higher level integration
tests in the front end, which abstract away from the inner components
implementation details and are closer to what the user sees (but they are also
longer and harder to build). At notabene we also used Cypress for smoke e2e
testing (I liked it, but I found it a bit unstable and slow, so we were using it
with basic cases instead of testing details and they were running on a daily
instead of every PR. Maybe it has improved or there are newer alternatives for
e2e)

### ❓What are your thoughts on using AI agents for coding and other work-related tasks? How do you use AI in your professional work?

⚡ (danger, this is one of the topics I’m quite obsessed about lately! I’ll try
to be brief)

In general, I love it! I think its super interesting, and definitively a game
changer for our craft. It even makes me feel as if I’m learning a new
profession. I think the technology is still early and that it will continue
improving and changing paradigms, so we need to keep our minds open, try new
things without going to crazy and trust our gut feeling on what is actually
valuable on a given context.

I’m personally using coding agents (right now I’m happy with Cursor, I also have
Codex integrated in there). I am enjoying running agents in the background
(nowadays playing with even running more than one at a time, for more trivial
tasks), I normally get pleasantly surprised on the quality of the output code,
but of course we need to review each change manually (and actually, the review
is what becomes the bottleneck, since we can only focus/review a given amount).
I believe sometime it can lead to dispersion and multitasking (pretty much like
working on a team with junior devs), but it keeps it fun and engaging and I feel
it’s totally worth it.

It’s hard for me to imagine how I could learn programming nowadays, without the
years of struggle against documentation and stack overflow. I feel privileged
that I get to see this technology at this moment on my career. I don’t think our
work is becoming obsolete (yet) since we get to have enough experience to review
the output and “drive” the machine.

I find it superhelpful on navigating new codebases, asking embarrassing
questions, bugfixing (we can even attach screenshots), refactoring, creating
unit tests, updating libraries and generating documentation. Tasks that could be
super time consuming before can be done in minutes now.

I love it for prototyping and vibe coding, and also we can very easily do design
work and UX directly in Cursor, and its very helpful also with styling, so it
can become a bridge for non-developers to step into the codebase and play around
and propose changes. I also find the output code normally quite beautiful, for
example it follows the React guidelines much better that many senior backend
devs lol

I’m very interested in how this tech can be integrated into the corporate flow
(agentic PR reviews, enforcing a certain common coding styleguide, leveraging
private internal data to enrich prompts, customise internal flows with MCPs,
etc)

Coding aside, I also find it potentially useful for any kind of communication
(emails, internal messaging, solving conflicts, RFCs, READMEs). Nowadays I might
like to speak to the LLM and then work out a structured message.

I also use it for research and browsing (now with Atlas browser)

In any case, at the same time there’s a big risk of becoming increasingly
dependent of this systems, to the point that we can “forget” our previous skills
(for example, sometimes I can feel insecure writing code without the AI
assistant now, so from time to time I force myself to code again in the
old-fashion way). Regarding communication, it can also make everything feel
AI-generated, which is impersonal and annoying.

As an example, I enjoyed “manually” answering the questions on this essay. I
hope it is easy to tell that I’m a human 🙂 

### ❓Non-technically, what are the most important factors for a software development project to succeed in both time and quality?

This is a very broad topic! I’ll try to sketch some ideas that come to mind
right now, and I guess there are some many angles that might be specific to the
company, project or team.

I had one CTO that liked to say “Sales are the department of promises, we are
the department of apologies 😀”

But in general:

- A reasonable quality/speed balance. This might depend on the project and the
  level of maturity (in an early startup or an experimental feature, we might
  just need to hack something that works, and if it does, improve it in a later
  iteration, while on a more mature product or a “core feature”, we might want
  to be very quality oriented, reviewing and testing heavily). In any case, the
  quality/speed balance should be aligned with the project needs.
- I like working in slices (like in Shape Up methodology), which is focusing on
  bulding flows that work first. It helps identifying and filtering the core
  important features and the nice-to-haves, being customer centric and
  activating the feedback loop earlier. It’s not necessary to follow
  particularly this methodology to benefit from this pattern!
- a few things about teammates:
  - should open to learning new things,
  - generous with helping out each other,
  - respectful of others work (avoiding micromanagement, trusting, empowering)
  - respecting commitments within the work methodology, offering feedback with
    radical candor if needed, also protecting each other from unreasonable
    demands from business and management while also having a company-wide
    high-level view on what is important and really ”moves the needle”
  - open to reduce scope if needed, if the deadlines are endangered
- Non technical people:
  - Ideally clear communication,
  - avoid changes of scope and respecting the sprints or commitments (try to not
    add new items randomly in the middle of a sprint),
  - reasonable time appetites (don’t plan assuming the optimal outcome)
  - compassionate about the great misteries of software development
